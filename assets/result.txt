Query: How does reward modeling work in Llama2-chat?
{
    "infer_time": 23.104567527770996,
    "result": "Reward modeling in Llama2-Chat involves using a reward function to score model responses based on their quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety). The scores are then used to optimize Llama 2-Chat during reinforcement learning with human feedback for better human preference alignment and improved helpfulness and safety."
